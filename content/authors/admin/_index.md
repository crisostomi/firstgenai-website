We are **First-Generation Students in AI** (*FGSAI*), an organization inspired by the belief that every student deserves equal opportunities to succeed in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI).

A first-generation student is an individual whose parents or guardians have not completed a bachelor's degree or higher, which often results in these students facing unique challenges in navigating higher education and professional opportunities.

Our initiative is founded on the understanding that the quality of information and guidance received in the early career stages is critical in determining future success. As a result, we place significant emphasis on outreach and information efforts, aiming to make the field equally accessible to all.

<!-- 
At the current time, there is a lack of data on the representation of first-generation students among AI workers. However, requiring similar levels of education and training, we can compare them to students enrolling in a Ph.D. program. The latter result to be more financially concerned, feel less support for their professional pursuits, and are less attracted to academic research [Insights into First-Generation Doctoral Students](https://cgsnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CGS_CP_First-Gen-Doc-Students_ForWeb.pdf). In the UK, for example, we have that while 70\% of undergraduate students are first-generation on average, they make up for only the 30\% of students in elite institutions like Oxford and Cambridge and result more likely to drop out [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/03054985.2020.1784714?needAccess=true&role=button&](Moving on up: "first in family" university graduates in England). These statistics underscore the disparity in accessing prestigious universities and subsequently attaining prominent positions in AI.
Part of our initial investigation will be targeted to fill this gap in the data, understanding the representation and challenges faced by first-generation students in AI. This information will help inform our strategies and efforts to promote greater inclusion and diversity in the field. We will also conduct a survey to understand their experiences and identify the resources they need to succeed.

Goals:
- We will prioritize our \textbf{outreach} and \textbf{information} efforts, developing targeted programs and informational materials to raise awareness about the potential of first-generation students in AI and the barriers they face in accessing elite institutions and prestigious positions. 
- By collaborating with educational institutions, industry, and government, we will work to ensure these students have access to resources and programs that support their academic and professional pursuits.  Recognizing the intersectional nature of underrepresentation in AI, we will partner with existing organizations like \textit{Black in AI}, \textit{Women in AI}, and \textit{Queer in AI} to ensure our efforts are inclusive and accessible to all.
- To foster a supportive community, we will create \textbf{platforms for collaboration} and \textbf{networking opportunities}. We will host a website and social media accounts to provide a central hub for information and resources, as well as a forum for discussion and collaboration. In addition, we will organize virtual and in-person events to bring together first-generation students in AI. These events will provide opportunities for networking, mentorship, and professional development, as well as a space for students to share their experiences and support one another.

driven by the motivation to empower first-generation students to succeed in AI and contribute to a diverse and innovative field. we will develop targeted outreach programs, promote equal opportunities, and foster a supportive community, ultimately creating a more inclusive AI field that benefits everyone.
